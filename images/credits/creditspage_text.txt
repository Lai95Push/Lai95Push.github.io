TITLE: Credits, citations, and words of thanks

SECTION 1:

This is a project that could not have been accomplished without a great deal of help, support, and other people. This project was also produced for my JOUR652 class at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland.

So to begin, I want to thank Kalani Gordon for being a great teacher, and incredibly supportive in a difficult time. Thank you so much.

Thank you to my brother, Aryeh L. Miller, who provided a voice for Dr. H. F. Parsons.

I also want to thank my classmates for their critiques and support.
